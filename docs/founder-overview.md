# Founder Overview

This document captures the current product vision for Creators Connect. Treat it as a living spec and keep it aligned with how the product actually behaves.

## Product summary
Creators Connect helps founders hire creators to drive organic, warm-lead traffic to their products. Founders browse creators, select a service type, make an offer, and pay into escrow. Funds release when the creator delivers the agreed evidence.

## Target users
- Founders who need distribution and warm leads.
- Creators who can promote products through content.

## Core flow
1. Founder browses creators, compares fit and pricing, and selects a service type.
2. Founder makes an offer and deposits funds into escrow.
3. Creator accepts or declines.
4. Creator delivers the content and submits evidence.
5. Escrow releases when the agreed evidence is verified.

## Evidence and escrow
Evidence is defined by the content type and platform. We start with a small, well-defined set of artifacts and expand over time. The system verifies delivery of the artifact, not subjective quality. See `docs/evidence-spec.md` for the initial rules.

## Disputes and safety
- We verify whether the agreed deliverable was provided.
- We do not arbitrate subjective quality unless fraud is involved.
- Fraud or suspicious activity can lead to removal from the platform.

## Monetization
- 3% to 5% service fee per order.
- Optional Pro subscription for a flat fee and 0% commission.
- Paid verification badge for creators.

## Verification
- Manual verification early on.
- Automated verification as volume grows.
- Potential identity verification later, if the value outweighs friction.

## Roadmap direction
- Matching algorithm that pairs founders with the most fitting creators for their product and audience.
- Expanded evidence coverage across additional platforms and content types.
- Improved trust signals for creators, including verification and performance history.

## Success metrics
- Founder repeat rate.
- Creator repeat rate.
- Completed orders per week.
- Time to first match.
- Dispute rate.
