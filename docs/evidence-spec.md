# Evidence Spec

This spec defines what counts as acceptable proof of delivery for each content type. It is intentionally strict to keep escrow decisions objective and fast.

## Evidence submission fields
- Platform.
- Content type.
- Public link to the artifact.
- Timestamp that highlights the product mention or CTA.
- Short summary of what was delivered.
- Optional screenshot if the content is in a private space.
- Optional analytics screenshot if performance reporting was part of the offer.

## Initial supported platforms and artifacts
- X (Twitter): Public post link and posting date. If the offer includes a CTA, the link or handle must be visible in the post.
- YouTube: Public video link and a timestamp for the product mention or CTA.
- TikTok: Public video link and a timestamp for the product mention or CTA.
- Instagram Reels: Public reel link and a timestamp for the product mention or CTA.
- Blog or newsletter: Public URL and publish date.
- Community post: Public link if available. If the community is private, provide a screenshot with timestamp and context.

## Escrow release rules
- If the required artifact is submitted and verifiable, escrow releases.
- If the required artifact is missing or invalid, escrow remains locked and the creator is asked to fix or resubmit.
- Subjective performance or quality disputes are not adjudicated unless fraud is involved.

## Expansion policy
New platforms or artifact types require a clear, verifiable evidence rule before they are accepted. This keeps the process scalable and fair.
